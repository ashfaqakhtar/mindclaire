                    <p>Dr. Ritu Goel, M.D., board-certified in General and Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, joins the
                        MedShadow Health & Medical Advisory Panel. She specializes in autism, developmental
                        disabilities, depression, anxiety, trauma, and sleep disorders. Dr. Goel combines evidence-based
                        prescribing with holistic strategies, including sleep optimization, nutrition, microbiome
                        health, mindfulness, psychotherapy, and family-school collaboration. Her approach empowers
                        families to make informed decisions about medication benefits and risks, emphasizing trial
                        windows, clear goals, and ongoing reassessment. By translating complex clinical research into
                        practical guidance, Dr. Goel helps families navigate care with clarity, compassion, and
                        confidence, supporting MedShadow’s mission of science-based medication safety and alternatives.”
