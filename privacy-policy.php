                    address, credit card information, photo, comments, images or videos. If you provide us with your

                    Privacy Policy. You acknowledge and agree that your decision to provide your Personal Information is
                    voluntary and constitutes clear, specific, unambiguous consent for us to collect, process and retain
                    your Personal Information. </p>

                <h3>A. Collection of Personal Information</h3>
                <p>We collect your Personal Information in the following ways, for the following reasons:</p>
                <p>1. When you enter information into our contact form, blog, social media page, online scheduler, take
                    a survey or quiz, or provide us with other communication details, we may collect your name, email
                    address, phone number and the text of any message you enter. We have the right to process this data
                    based on our legitimate interest in communicating with you and responding to your questions or
                    concerns. We may retain such information for our communication records.</p>
                <p>2. When you “opt in” to receive communication from us in exchange for a free resource or training, we
                    will collect your name and email address. We have the right to process this data for the purpose it
                    was collected, based on your clear affirmative consent, and may also send you additional email
                    marketing based on our legitimate interest in marketing to users who have demonstrated an interest
                    in our Services. We may also offer you the opportunity to “opt in” to our email list and will obtain
                    separate consent for that. If you give consent to “opt in” to receive communication from us, you may
                    withdraw your consent at any time, by following the guidelines in section G. of this Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <p>3. When you “opt in” to our email list, we will collect your name and email address. We have the
                    right to process this data based on either your clear affirmative consent to be added, or through
                    our legitimate interest in direct marketing to you. If you give consent to “opt in” to our email
                    list, you may withdraw your consent at any time, by following the guidelines in section G. of this
                    Privacy Policy. We may use your data to send you social media marketing or to create lookalike
                    audiences through our social media platforms. In addition, we may use a tracking feature in our
                    emails to collect information about the opening, clicking and forwarding of our emails to refine our
                    future marketing. </p>
                <p>4. When you become a customer, and make a purchase from us, we will collect information necessary to
                    complete your transaction, including your name, email address, phone number, billing address, credit
                    card and payment details. We have the right to process this data based on our contractual obligation
                    to fulfill your purchase. We will not retain such information any longer than necessary. We may use
                    third party data processors to transact your purchase and in that case, we will not have access to
                    your payment information.</p>

                <h3>C. SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
                <p>You have the right to be informed about how your information is being shared. We take appropriate
                    actions to protect and maintain the confidentiality of your Personal Information. </p>
                <p>1. We will share your Personal Information in limited circumstances for specific, limited purposes
                    with trusted third parties, including our email management service and other members of our team who
                    assist us in operating our website, managing our business, or providing legal or accounting services
                    for us. </p>
                <p>2. We will share the Personal Information that you provide to us when making a purchase with
                    additional trusted third parties, including our payment processor and financial gateway to assist in
                    completing the financial transaction. </p>
                <p>3. We may share your Personal Information in the event of a sale of our company or with a joint
                    venture or affiliate partner if necessary.
                    Your Personal Information will only be shared and processed for the specific, limited purpose as
                    necessary. Your Personal Information will never be sold or given to any other entity without your
                    consent, beyond what is required to complete a purchase or request. To the best of our abilities,
                    trusted third parties with whom we share your Personal Information will keep such information
                    confidential and will not disclose it to any other party, unless required to do so by law.
                </p>
                <p>Although we aim to keep your Personal Information confidential, we may share your Personal
                    Information if we are required to do so by law. We may also share your Personal Information if there
                    is an attempted breach of security of our website, a perceived violation of this Privacy Policy or
                    other agreements governing the use of our website or business, a threat to personal safety, property
                    or rights of persons, including users of this website and others, or on the good faith belief that
                    disclosure is necessary to identify or prevent an injury to our users, our property or the general
                    public.</p>
                <p>By visiting and using our website, you acknowledge and agree that we may share your Personal
                    Information in these ways, consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>D. STORAGE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
                <p>You have the right to be informed about how your information is being stored.</p>
                <p>Personal Information collected from you is stored through a data management system. This information
                    may be accessed by third parties who help us obtain, manage or store that Information. Our website
                    and servers are located in the United States and are governed by the laws of the United States, the
                    state of California and the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) as it applies to information
                    collected in the European Union. All information collected by us will be processed in the United
                    States. If information is collected by us outside the United States, it will be transferred to the
                    United States for processing and storing, and may be transferred back out of the United States for
                    further processing. If your Personal Information is transferred to a country that has less
                    protective laws than the country of your residence, it will be governed by this Privacy Policy. </p>
                <p>By visiting and using our website, you acknowledge and agree that we may store and transfer your
                    Personal Information in these ways, consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>E. PROTECTION AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
                <p>The security of your Personal Information, including information you voluntarily provide to us and
                    that which we collect automatically, is important to us and we use our best efforts to protect it.
                    We strive to use industry standard commercially acceptable online security measures, including a
                    Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) on our website and only share your information with third parties who
                    we have researched and determined to be compliant with current safety standards. However, no
                    transmission over the internet or methods of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
                <p>While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we are not responsible should an unauthorized
                    third party gain access to your information, without our consent. In the event that mindclaire.com
                    is tampered with, your information may be inadvertently intercepted. If we become aware that a data
                    breach has occurred, we will notify the appropriate authorities within a timely manner. You
                    acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for these actions and any damages that result from
                    the unauthorized use of your Personal Information. You expressly agree to hold us harmless from any
                    and all claims which may arise from the unauthorized use of your Personal Information.</p>
                <p>Please note, when you voluntarily give out your Personal Information online through our website or on
                    our social media page, in a way that makes it viewable by others, whether through a comment on a
                    blog, a posting on a message board, or by any other means, it can be viewed by the public and can
                    potentially be collected and used by others. You acknowledge and agree that we cannot guarantee the
                    security of the information you share in this manner. You expressly agree that you disclose such
                    information at your own risk and you assume all responsibility for its unauthorized use. </p>
                <p>Because our core activities do not consist of processing operations which require regular and
                    systematic processing of data subjects on a large scale, nor do we process sensitive data on a large
                    scale, we have determined that MindClaire PC is not required to appoint a Data Protection Officer.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>F. RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
                <p>We only retain the minimum Personal Information necessary to fulfill the specific, limited purpose
                    for which it was collected. We also retain and process Personal Information for reasonable business
                    purposes, including legal compliance, financial record keeping and dispute resolution. </p>
                <br>
                <h3>G. RIGHT TO CONTROL PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
                <p>You have the right to control your Personal Information including the right to access, receive a copy
                    of, update, edit, delete, erase or restrict the processing of your Personal Information. </p>
                <p>You may request information on how your Personal Information is being used and processed, request
                    access to, request a copy of, restrict our use and processing of, or request to update, edit, delete

                <p>You also have the right to be forgotten, and may withdraw your consent previously given to us, by
                    “opting-out” or unsubscribing from our email list through an online automated process at your own
                    discretion, at any time. To “opt-out” or unsubscribe from our list, you may click the unsubscribe
