                <p>Welcome to my practice, Mindclaire. I’m an integrative psychiatrist who believes in nurturing
                    mental wellness by harmoniously integrating the wisdom of traditional psychiatry with the
                    personalized touch of holistic healing methods.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    My approach combines traditional psychiatric treatments with holistic methods to help you feel
                    more confident, perform better at school or work, and enhance your relationships. Whether it's
                    improving focus, managing emotions, or boosting social skills, my personalized treatment plans
                    are tailored to your unique needs. They include education, nutrition, exercise, therapy,
                    medications, supplementation, meditation, spiritual guidance through yoga and more.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    For children, adolescents and families, I work closely with parents to support your child's
                    mental health, helping you to foster a nurturing environment at home. I understand the struggles
                    of navigating these conditions. I'm here to make you feel equipped, and empowered to improve
                    your quality of life.

                <p>My journey into mental health began with the desire to understand the mind's intricacies and to
                    offer
                    relief not just from symptoms but to achieve overall well-being. With over two decades of
                    experience
                    across the globe, my treatment philosophy has been shaped by the myriad of stories that spoke of
                    a
                    need for a more compassionate, and comprehensive approach to psychiatric care.

                    <br>

                    At MindClaire, I am committed to fostering an environment that supports growth, understanding,
                    and
                    lasting change.

                </h1>
                <p>My educational journey began in India, where I completed medical school and MD degree, followed
                    by advanced psychiatric training at the NHS in the UK, and further specialization; residency and
                    child and adolescent psychiatry fellowship in the United States at the University of Buffalo.
                    Each step in my journey has not only provided me with a robust understanding of mental health
                    but also an appreciation for the diverse ways in which it impacts individuals and families. My
                    recent training includes an executive program in artificial intelligence from MIT and
                    integrative psychiatry at Dream Practice Academy, equipping me with cutting-edge tools to
                    complement traditional practices.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Throughout over two decades, from roles as a Senior House Officer to leading as a Child and
                    Adolescent Psychiatrist at esteemed institutions like Johns Hopkins and SCPMG Kaiser Mental
                    Health, I have honed my approach to focus on developmental disabilities, and co-occurring
                    psychiatric conditions in young populations. My practice thrives on a blend of empathy,
                    evidence, and innovation, reflecting my commitment not only to care but also to educate and
                    mentor the next generation of mental health professionals.

                <h1>Beyond the clinic, I am a storyteller, an adventurer, and a lifelong learner. Motherhood has been my
                    most rewarding role, guiding two energetic boys through the wonders of soccer, baseball, tennis,
                    golf,
                    swimming, chess and more. Our family adventures, from ziplining, horseback riding to exploring local
                    trails, are cherished chapters in my story. I am also a devoted caretaker to our three dogs, who
                    teach
                    me daily about loyalty and unconditional love.
                    My personal journey with mental health began in my teenage years, observing the silent struggles of
                    loved ones with learning disabilities. These early experiences profoundly shaped my clinical focus
                    and
                    my holistic view of psychiatric care, emphasizing the importance of understanding each individual's
                    unique experiences.

                <p>At MindClaire, I see beyond the symptoms. My approach integrates traditional psychiatric care
                    with nutraceuticals, nutrition, therapy, and innovative treatments like AI-driven diagnostics and

                    and their families to understand and manage their conditions effectively, providing a supportive
                    environment that fosters growth and healing.</p>

                    and spiritual dimensions of health.
