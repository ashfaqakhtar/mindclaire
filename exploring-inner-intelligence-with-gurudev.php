                <div class="blog-detail-body">
                    <p>Dr Ritu Goel joined leaders in science, technology, and consciousness for the private launch of
                        the Institute of Absolute Intelligence at the Art of Living Foundation in downtown Los Angeles.
                        This gathering explored how intuition-the innate “sixth sense” beyond sight, sound, and
                        touch-can be cultivated to expand human potential and redefine the nature of intelligence
                        itself.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The event featured Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, whose reflections on peace, awareness, and
                        purposeful living resonate deeply with MindClaire’s integrative psychiatry philosophy. A
                        highlight of the day was a live demonstration by three young participants trained in the Art of
                        Living’s Intuition Program, who performed complex tasks without using any of their physical
                        senses. Their accuracy and clarity offered a glimpse into how awakened intuition can serve the
                        greater good - the program has even been applied to help locate missing persons.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>At MindClaire, we see immense potential in exploring consciousness not only through neuroscience
                        but also through practices that awaken perception, empathy, and absolute inner intelligence.
                        Experiences like this strengthen our commitment to understanding human potential through both
                        scientific rigor and experiential learning - integrating emotional regulation, awareness, and
                        inner wisdom.</p>
